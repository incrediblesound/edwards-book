# Creativity

  Edwards is a creative family. We almost all practice some art form. Wendell and James make music, Emily paints, Rebecca makes collages, Eric writes poetry. Edwards are also known for practicing their art in the way they personally enjoy with little respect for what is standard or mainstream. Wendell makes drones, James makes music with dissonance, Emily makes abstract paintings based on butterfly wings, Rebecca uses found objects and old toys for her collages, and Eric's poetry is... well, it's Eric's.

  None of us are extraordinarily gifted at what we do. We are not a family of prodigies. Rather, creative production is a part of our daily lives. Proficiency in the art that we practice is attained by consistently having a project to work on. Our skill is the result of the regular production of artistic works and the practice of techniques over time. It is not important to us that we make money by our art or gain recognition, for we delight in the process of creativity for its own sake and for the enjoyment of the artistic works themselves.
