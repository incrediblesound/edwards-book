## Sylvia Bitler Pierce Early Memories
*transcribed from tape by Rebecca Edwards*

I was born on January 4, 1921 in Belmont, MA., at 15 Chester Rd. I was born at home in an upstairs apartment of a 2 family house. My older sister Helen Cescillia was born 5 years before me. I called her “sis-dah,” and that is how she became known as “Dah.” When I was 6 months old we moved to Waban. Mom was 30 and Dad was 33 yrs old. There we lived in a comfortable brick house, 192 Nehoiden Rd, off Beacon St. There was lots of land behind the house, where Dad liked to garden. He was a banker, and eventually became the chief executive officer of the National Shaumet Bank of Boston.

My mother was a homemaker. From my earliest memories we had an Irish maid, live in, who cooked and helped take care of us.
There was a big garden next door, where Mr Lockwood gardened. I loved to follow him around while he watered. He carried 2 watering cans. I would invariably ask him, “Why do you have 2 watering cans?” He would reply, “To make little girls ask questions!”

Beyond Dads garden lived the Millers. Johnny Miller was my playmate at age 4 or 5. He got to wear overalls to play in...I wasn't allowed to wear pants, I wore little dresses that grandmother sewed. I recall one orange and red sheer dress with a big yellow hem. One night I was put to bed while it was still light out. That made me unhappy. Finally my mother allowed me to get up, put the dress on and go out to play till it got dark.

Father was born in and brought up in Brattleboro VT. His dad was a member of the VT legislature, and ran the Retreat Farm for the Brattleboro Retreat Hospital for mentally ill, some of whom worked on the farm. Father attended Amherst College, graduating in 1909. He went to Boston U. for grad work in finance. My father's siblings were: Milton, George, Fred (who died in CA), Weed (who died young), and Nathan. He also had a younger sister Helen, whom he was quite close to. She moved to Eureka, KS, where her mother lived, after she married. Helen taught school for many years, and married a lawyer named Edward Pedroja.  They had 2 children Paula and Helen Pedroja. Both of fathers parents died before I was born.

My mother was born and brought up in Eureka. She had 2 older brothers named Owen and Ed Bitler. Her full name was Vashti Cecelia Bitler. Her mother was Cary Ladd Bitler. I never knew grandpa.

My mom was quite spoiled as her folks bought her a grand piano. They also gave her a pump organ made by Este Organ Co of Brattleboro. She had it shipped out to Kansas. Vashti went to boarding school in Kansas City, then went to Boston and attended Emerson College of Oratory. Which is now just called Emerson College. While in Boston Vashti met her husband.

My sister Dah was born in 1917 in Medford. When we lived in Waban my little brother George Gilbert was born. I nicknamed him “Bowdy.”  In that house we had 3 large bedrooms, 2 smaller ones, and my sister and I had the small ones. When I learned to read I loved to read in bed. Dad would come in and say “I might have to call the police station if you don't turn off the light and go to sleep!”

Dad was a lot of fun. When the maid was out on Sunday night, he'd prepare supper of “dip toast” and poached eggs. You dip toast into boiled water, then put egg on the mushy toast. We thought it was wonderful. We'd also make popcorn balls of the popcorn he popped. I loved to sit on his lap while he ate an apple. He'd peel the apple then cut little chips and call them puppy dog names. At this time he began to travel to Europe on business, on a ocean liner. He brought back a French doll one year when he returned just in time for Christmas. I didnt think she was very pretty; she was made of felt and dressed very stylishly. She didnt have a pretty face and her hair was kind of funny. Her name was Lena, a name I didnt like. I pretended I liked her. The same Christmas I received a big doll with real hair and eyes that shut. I think I have a photo of me holding that doll.

My grandmother was a talented seamstress and made clothes for the dolls, so they always had a large wardrobe. During those years, in the summer, my mother would take the 3 of us plus the maid to Eureka. We took the 20th Century LMT train out of Boston. I remember the train had a little drying room. Grandmother had a wonderful, big old house. I recall a picture of myself there, in an Indian suit with roller skates. On the 4th of July (I was 4, or 6) we threw balls called torpedoes down onto the cement and they would explode. I recall a neighbor named Mr Barbour who kept peacocks. There was a loft over grandmas garage where big sacks of black walnuts were stored. I can remember the smell of those black walnuts to this day.

When I was about 6 yrs old we stopped going to KS, it was awfully hot there in the summer. A few summers were spent at Spaford Lake, N.H., not far from Brattleboro. We rented a cottage right on the lake, had a rowboat, and played at the waters edge making little houses of moss and twigs. I have photos that show my sister and cousin Doris, who was Dah's age, and a neighbor girl also their age. They were in the water while I stood on a big rock, sticking my tongue out at them. I guess I was mad because I didnt have anyone to play with!
